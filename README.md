# AI-Driven-Educational-Enhancement

Project Advisor: Prof. Silvia Figueira (Frugal Innovation Hub, Santa Clara University)
•	Implemented AI-powered homework generation and handwritten work authentication using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automated evaluation and verification of student submissions.
•	Developed a customized class planning system based on student feedback and behavioral analysis, incorporating automatic video content generation for personalized learning.
•	Built an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system integrated with an iPad application, deployed using Flutter on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
•	Designed and deployed an AI-driven class monitoring system for video analysis, enhancing student engagement tracking and evaluation.
•	Implemented a reward-based reinforcement learning algorithm using OpenCV for processing image data, achieving a 76% peak accuracy over 1,000 epochs to dynamically allocate points to students during a Robotics Hackathon
